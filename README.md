During my internship as a Quantitative Research Intern at Definer, I had the incredible opportunity to work on diverse projects in the digital assets domain, focusing on modeling a crypto pool ( Uniswap V3) and developing a convolutional neural network (CNN) for prediction and machine learning-based trading algorithms.
Throughout my internship, I focused on developing advanced machine-learning techniques to model and understand the dynamics of crypto markets. I collected and processed extensive datasets, including historical price data, trading volumes, and market sentiment indicators, to build comprehensive models that captured the complexities of the cryptocurrency landscape.
One of my key accomplishments during the internship was spearheading the modeling of a crypto pool, where I applied my quantitative research skills to analyze the behavior of different cryptocurrencies within a pool. I leveraged statistical methods and mathematical models to evaluate the performance and risk associated with the pool, providing valuable insights for decision-making and portfolio optimization.
